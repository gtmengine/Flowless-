### Single Purpose Description
```
reduce distraction on social platforms by hiding infinite news feeds and showing one short inspirational quote instead. Messaging, search, profiles and other site features remain accessible
```

### Permission Justifications

**storage:**
```
'storage' is used to save non-personal settings: per-site on/off state, last quote shown, and minimal UI preferences. No personal data, browsing history, or identifiers are collected. Values are small key-value pairs and may sync across the user's devices.
```

**scripting:**
```
'scripting' is used to inject a small, deterministic content script on user-selected sites to hide feed containers and render a static quote element. No keystrokes or personal content are read, stored or transmitted. Injection occurs only on domains explicitly enabled by the user in the UI.
```
