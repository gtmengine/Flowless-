#### D. Privacy Tab

**Single purpose:**
```
reduce distraction on social platforms by hiding infinite news feeds and showing one short inspirational quote instead. Messaging, search, profiles and other site features remain accessible
```

**Permission justifications:**

For `storage`:
```
'storage' is used to save non-personal settings: per-site on/off state, last quote shown, and minimal UI preferences. No personal data, browsing history, or identifiers are collected. Values are small key-value pairs and may sync across the user's devices.
```

For `scripting`:
```
'scripting' is used to inject a small, deterministic content script on user-selected sites to hide feed containers and render a static quote element. No keystrokes or personal content are read, stored or transmitted. Injection occurs only on domains explicitly enabled by the user in the UI.
```

**Remote code:**
- Select: **"No, I am not using Remote code"**

**Data usage:**
- Check: **NONE of the checkboxes** (no data is collected)

**Certifications:**
- ‚úÖ I do not sell or transfer user data to third parties
- ‚úÖ I do not use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to my item's single purpose
- ‚úÖ I do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
